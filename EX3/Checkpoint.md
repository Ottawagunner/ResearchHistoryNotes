Checkpoint ONE
--------------

####The Plan
Primary Data: [Reddit](www.reddit.com) & [Twitter](www.twitter.com)
    It's very open data formated in easy JSON files.


Collection method: Python scripts are avalible, wget will work as well as it's plain JSON collection. There are some GUI's avalible to work with it. 

Repository structure:[Repo is here](https://github.com/Ottawagunner/RedditData) 
Secondary Readings: 

I want to look at the corrilations between Pro and Anti firearms and see if there is a trend of events that would explain the surges in pro or anti gun messages. As well compare this with the Twitter data. and look for corralations and differences.
