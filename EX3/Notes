####BrainStorming
Need to think of an idea for this class, the idea of transcribing newspaper ads for this project is not a great Idea. I need to find some data set that I could take and build off of. going to do it anyways in a short sections.

Using Ottawa Citizen from 1870+ as that was the first year of constant papers.

Look and cut out all the ads, transcribe and document
