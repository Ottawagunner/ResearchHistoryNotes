###Voyant
I looked at Voyant as a topic model but instead of using the default data I used my project data. The data was a selection of text. I applyed the default english stopwords and created a word cloud. I see some patterns usinging the keywords alongside world leaders. I can see what people say about the leaders. The most useful tool I found was the words used in between keywords. It could show me the topics of how the leaders were talked about.
