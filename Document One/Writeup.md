Why am I here?
======
Well the reason I'm here is beacuse I am both a Computer Science Major and have a History Minor. When I saw Digital History it enticed me. I was part of the *Video Game Development* stream, but recently exited it. The use of visualizations in history was very exciting for me as my background in the Video Game stream seemed relevent. My background in Computer Science I feel will help me in this course as I have expirence with Github, Markdown languages, and Computer Graphics. At the end of the day I want a better connection between History and Technology, It's something that interests **me**.
The Experience.
------
The Digital Expirence I've had is probobly more technical, and advanced than most. I've really been missing out on the more practical side of Digital Technologies. It's intersting contrast in making software and programs and then seeing how they are used and more importantly **what is missing from them.** I have an extensive knowlage of how to make programs, but not what people want from these programs. Hopefully my experience in this class will shed light on what certian facilties want in tools. I really want the opurtunity to use some cool computer science tools in my final product.
