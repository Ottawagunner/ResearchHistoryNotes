####Methods for data collection
Will be using PRAW to download comments on reddit that refer to world war two leaders. From these comments we do a topic model and then figure out the basis on how these leaders are talked about in a social medium

We can then sort by world leader and the topics that they are referd by.

####Methods for data visualisations

Looking at a networking graph where topics and leaders are nodes and the size of line represent the strength of relation.
